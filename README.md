## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Abhishek.

I'm a 4th year CS undergraduate at MIT, Manipal. I like to build toys for the web and dabble in some ML when I can. In my free time I can be found reading a book or noodling on the guitar. I reside on the internet right [here](https://databhishek.me).

Here are a couple of other places I can be found in on the interweb.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/databhishek"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn--_.svg?style=social&logo=linkedin" alt="LinkedIn"></a>

That's mostly it. If you have anything you'd like to ask or if you'd like to collaborate, you can hit me up on [email](mailto:abhi.aryan98@gmail.com).
